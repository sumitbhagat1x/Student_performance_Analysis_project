# Dashboard Report: Student Performance Analysis

ðŸš€ 1. Project Overview:
This is a Student Performance Analysis project. The data was provided in raw form, and the goal was to extract meaningful insights from the messy dataset.

## Steps Involved:

âœ… Cleaned the data using Power Query Editor

âœ… Made necessary changes to the dataset

âœ… Built charts and pivot tables (used column, line and stacked charts)

âœ… Added two slicers (Gender and Department Category) for dynamic filtering

## ðŸ›  2. Tools Used:
1. Microsoft Excel â€“ for charts, pivot tables, and extracting insights

2. Power Query Editor (PQ) â€“ Primarily for cleaning and transforming data

## ðŸ“Š 3. Dashboard Highlights (Useful Insights):
âœ… Top five students who got 1st to 5th rank

âœ… Average attendance by departments

âœ… Average study weekly hours and extracurricular activities by age

âœ… Avg marks by age

...and many more insightful metrics!

## ðŸ“š 4. Report:
If you see the dashboard, you will observe that the  â€˜Business departmentâ€™ has average attendance more compared to other departments. 
In contrast CS department has the least average attendance.
Those students who have participated in or are part of extracurricular activities do more studies compared to those who didnâ€™t join curriculum activities. But those students who are above 22 and have not participated in curriculum activities devote more time to studies.

## Recommendations:
Promote extracurricular activities more, so that students will participate in activities.
